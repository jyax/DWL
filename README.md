Dynamic Windows (aka Dynamic Window Logger) is a current extension-based application that keeps snapshots of browser windows. It creates an easy to use environment where you can keep windows organized and open them and close on the fly.

This tool has been created with the purpose of cleaning up a bad habit of mine which is keep a large amount of tabs and windows open due to feeling like I would lose out on some of the information if I closed it and couldn't find it again. I wanted to make this tool keeping in mind that there currently exist some systems that implement some of these ideas. One major idea is keeping a save state of a window. An example of this is any typical browser saving where you last left off when you reopen the browser application, it can remember the last window and the tabs within that window. The last large idea is being able to save the window to create an easy way to reaccess the pages needed as well as save any updates made to the window whenever made (tab removed, updated, or deleted).
